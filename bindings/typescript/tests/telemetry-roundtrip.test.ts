/**
 * Byte-parity round-trip: `parse(serialize(x))` must preserve EVERY field the
 * Rust sender emits — including the two additive identity fields `iface` and
 * `link_id`.
 *
 * Why this exists as its own suite: a Zod object strips what its schema does not
 * declare, silently and successfully. A reader that has simply never heard of
 * `iface`/`link_id` therefore parses a mapped snapshot with no error at all and
 * hands the consumer a document with both modems' identities deleted — which is
 * exactly what the released `@ceralive/srtla-send@2026.6.2` reader did, and
 * exactly the failure mode a "does it parse?" test cannot see.
 *
 * Re-serializing the parsed document and comparing it to the producer's original
 * bytes DOES see it: a dropped field changes the bytes. The fixtures read here
 * are written by the Rust producer (`tests/telemetry_fixtures.rs`) and asserted
 * byte-identical to this package's copies by `tests/telemetry_fixture_parity.rs`,
 * so the comparison is against the sender's real output, not a transcription of
 * it. `falsifies the byte-parity assertion` below proves the check discriminates.
 *
 * The schema declares its keys in the producer's own field order, so a
 * round-tripped document is byte-identical rather than merely equivalent.
