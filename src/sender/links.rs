//! Where the sender's uplink set comes from, across startup and every reload.
//!
//! Two sources, and only one of them is new. Without `--bind-map` the sender
//! reads `BIND_IPS_FILE` exactly as it always has and every uplink is unmapped —
//! no hashing, no sidecar, no new failure mode. With `--bind-map` the same IP
//! file is read through the ADR-003 pair protocol, and the resolution decides
//! whether the mapping is in force, whether the last valid one is retained, or
//! whether the sender falls open to legacy behavior with the ambiguity named.
//!
//! This type owns the one piece of state that decision needs: the last mapping
//! actually applied. That is what distinguishes a startup degradation (nothing
//! to retain, so collisions are excluded and reported) from a reload degradation
//! (a live bond is already interface-pinned, so it is kept running).
