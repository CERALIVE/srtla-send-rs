//! The egress-binding step of a housekeeping tick.
//!
//! `SO_BINDTODEVICE` freezes an ifindex at bind time, and neither the kernel nor
//! the SRTLA protocol tells the sender when that index stops describing the
//! device. Nothing else in the tick would notice: the liveness timeout only
//! measures inbound silence, and a blackholed route produces no error at all. So
//! every tick re-resolves the interface by name and re-reads the route
//! invariant, which bounds detection to one housekeeping interval.
//!
//! Read-only with respect to the host: a name lookup and a route-table read. No
//! rule, route, or policy-routing table is ever installed.
