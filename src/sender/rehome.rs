//! Whole-bond re-home: move every uplink to a newly-resolved receiver address
//! and register from scratch.
//!
//! # Why the whole bond, or nothing
//!
//! SRTLA registration binds the bond to a receiver-generated connection id
//! (REG1 → REG2 → REG3). That id only means something to the receiver *instance*
//! that minted it, so repointing one uplink at a fresh DNS answer would split
//! the bond across two receiver identities — the moved link would arrive at an
//! instance that has never heard of our group and would be worse off than it was
//! talking to a stale address. The per-uplink reconnect path therefore never
//! swaps `io.remote` (it only warns; see [`super::connections`]). This module is
//! the one sanctioned place that address changes, and only because it changes it
//! for **every** uplink in the same housekeeping pass and then re-registers the
//! whole bond.
//!
//! # When it fires
//!
//! Conservatively, and only from the dead-bond branch of housekeeping. Every one
//! of these must hold:
//!
//! 1. Every uplink has timed out (`active_connections == 0`) *and* has stayed
//!    that way past the existing all-links-failed window
//!    ([`super::housekeeping::GLOBAL_TIMEOUT_MS`]) — the same timer that already
//!    decides the bond is unrecoverable, not a second parallel one. A bond with
//!    any live uplink is never re-homed.
//! 2. A fresh resolution of the receiver hostname succeeds *and* answers with
//!    none of the addresses the bond is pinned to. A failed or empty lookup is
//!    not drift, and a reordered multi-A answer that still lists one of our
//!    addresses is not drift either.
//! 3. The per-process rate limit allows it: at most one probe+re-home attempt
//!    per [`REHOME_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`].
//!
//! Nothing about the wire changes: the move is a plain RTT probe followed by the
//! standard REG1/REG2/REG3 flow, indistinguishable to the C reference receiver,
//! BELABOX, or irlserver `srtla_rec` from a sender that just started.
//!
//! # Composing with a SIGHUP IP reload
//!
//! Re-home rebuilds whatever uplinks the bond currently has, so it always runs
//! against the local-IP set that the last accepted reload installed. In the
//! other direction, a reload that lands *after* a re-home dials any newly added
//! uplink through [`crate::net::resolve_remote_for_source`], which picks the first
//! answer in the source socket's family, just as this module does, so it joins the
//! bond at the address the bond just moved to. Neither order can leave uplinks
//! split across two receivers.
