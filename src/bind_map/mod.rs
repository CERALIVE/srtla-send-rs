//! Optional versioned bind-map sidecar (ADR-003).
//!
//! `srtla_send` has always identified an uplink by its local source IP. That is
//! not enough on a real modem bond: two identical HiLink modems both present
//! `192.168.8.100`, and the pool builder silently collapses the second into the
//! first. This module adds the missing channel — a **separate, optional** JSON
//! sidecar (`--bind-map <path>`) that describes `BIND_IPS_FILE` positionally,
//! naming each row's stable `link_id` and its egress interface.
//!
//! Two properties are load-bearing:
//!
//! * **`BIND_IPS_FILE` stays byte-unchanged.** Without `--bind-map` this module
//!   is never entered and behavior is byte-identical to before.
//! * **Degradation never guesses.** An unusable map falls open (the stream keeps
//!   running) but never blindly collapses an ambiguous same-IP group — the
//!   ambiguity is reported instead.
