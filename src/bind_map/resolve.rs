//! Fail-open, duplicate-safe resolution (ADR-003 §6).
//!
//! Fail-open means "keep streaming". It does not mean "guess". The naive
//! fallback — no map, so collapse duplicate IPs and carry on — is exactly the
//! silent-collapse bug this contract exists to fix, so degradation never
//! blindly collapses an ambiguous group.
//!
//! Startup and reload get different answers because they have different
//! material: startup has nothing to retain, reload has a known-good pool.
//!
//! The vocabulary this module decides in ([`BindMapStatus`],
//! [`BindMapDisposition`], [`CollisionGroup`]) is spelled once in
//! [`super::status`]; nothing here re-declares it.
